SYMPOSIUM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


1.	   Symposium Management System is an interface between the College Student and the Symposium organizers who conduct Symposium in their respective College or University.
2.	       It aims at providing all possible information to the participants of the symposium.
3.	      The information include date and time, venue, list of events, information regarding how to reach the venue and so on.

4.	   This system also provides online registration facility which in turn helps the organizers to preplan the event based on the number of participants.

5.	   If some other way of registration like registering through phone call or sms or email may requires the organizer to make manual entries somewhere else.

6.	   These manual entries may require more time and if the list is prepared in a handbook, the handbook must be kept safe and a person should be allocated to do the task.

7.	   Xampp server suits the best for compiling and executing the php code. Phpmyadmin supports in the creation and maintenance of mysql database and tables.

The project was developed as a part of the curriculum for the course IP lab(CS405).
